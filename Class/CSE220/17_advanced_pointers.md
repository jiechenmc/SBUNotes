Function pointer syntax

```c
rtype (\*fn) (args...)
```


• A structure that contains a flexible array member is an incomplete type.
• An incomplete type is missing part of the information needed to determine how
much memory it requires.
• An incomplete type can’t be a member of another structure or an element of an
array.

However, an array may contain pointers to structures that have a flexible array
member
