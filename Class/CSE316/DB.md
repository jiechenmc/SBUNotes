Impedance mismatch is a term used in computer science to describe the problem that arises when two systems or components that are supposed to work together have different data models, structures, or interfaces that make communication difficult or inefficient.

**Relational** based on sets

**Relational DB solves that problem since the data models is consistent.**

Relational Advantage
- Data is structured so it eliminates the impedance mismatch problem

Relational Disadvantage
- Complicated data access


**Non-Relational** based on aggregates

Advantage
- Fast Access

Disadvantage
- Bad for data management, duplicates
