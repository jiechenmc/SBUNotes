**Mobile Edge computing** - mobile users can utilize the computing services from the base station
(provides the off-load processing, application services and storage close to the end users).

**Fog computing** - enables the applications to run directly at the network edge through billions of smart connected devices

**Cloudlets** - allows access to the Cloud by using the computer resources available in the local network

**Edge devices** like routers, access points, and base station host different services (e.g., QoS, VPN, and Voice over IP etc.)

>[!info] Edge devices act as a bridge that connects the smart mobile devices with the cloud

Edge computing is characterized in terms of high band- width, ultra-low latency, and real-time access to the network information that can be used by several applications

Edge computing **complements** Cloud computing by enhancing the end user service for delay-sensitive applications

Cloud is centralized while Edge is distributed.
Data en-route attacks are higher in cloud servers because of the longer path to the server.
